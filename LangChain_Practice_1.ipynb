      "text: This leaf blower is pretty amazing.  It has four settings:candle blower, gentle breeze, windy city, and tornado. It arrived in two days, just in time for my wife's anniversary present. I think my wife liked it so much she was speechless. So far I've been the only one using it, and I've been using it every other morning to clear the leaves on our lawn. It's slightly more expensive than the other leaf blowers out there, but I think it's worth it for the extra features.\n",
