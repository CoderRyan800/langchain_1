Based on the provided context, the research presented in this document appears to be innovative in its specific application and approach. The document discusses the development of a form of self-awareness in LSTM-based agents, where the agents are capable of displaying their knowledge state, answering questions based on their state of knowledge, and seeking assistance when they are unable to answer a question. This form of self-awareness is focused on the agents' understanding of their own knowledge state and their ability to use this knowledge to cooperate in problem-solving.

While the concept of self-awareness in neural networks has been studied before, as referenced in survey paper [9], the authors of this document emphasize that their work differs from the methods presented in the survey. Their approach focuses on a simple form of symbolic, conceptual self-awareness not at the neural layer but at the level of logic concepts.

Therefore, while the general concept of self-awareness in neural networks is not new, the specific approach and application presented in this document appear to be innovative. However, without further information or a more comprehensive review of the literature in this field, it's not possible to definitively state whether there are other works that have explored this specific approach.
