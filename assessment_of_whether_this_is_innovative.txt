Based on the provided context, it appears that the research is innovative in its specific approach to self-awareness in neural networks. The study focuses on developing a form of self-awareness in an LSTM-based agent, where the agent is capable of displaying its knowledge state and answering questions based on its state of knowledge. If the agent is unable to answer a question, it will indicate this and request assistance from another agent. This form of self-awareness and cooperation between agents seems to be a unique aspect of this research.

However, the concept of self-awareness in neural networks is not entirely new. The context mentions that self-awareness in neural networks has been studied before, and a survey paper on this topic is referenced as [9]. The specific methods and approaches used in this research differ from those presented in the survey paper, which focused on introspection at the architectural, physical, and circuit layers. This research, on the other hand, focuses on a simple form of symbolic, conceptual self-awareness at the level of logic concepts. 

Without more information, it's hard to definitively say whether this research is entirely innovative or a repetition of existing studies. However, based on the provided context, it seems that while the general concept of self-awareness in neural networks is not new, the specific approach and methods used in this research are unique.
