As an AI, I don't have personal opinions, but I can analyze the information provided. The LSTM agents paper presents an interesting approach to self-awareness in LSTM-based agents, focusing on the agent's ability to understand its own knowledge state and cooperate with other agents to solve problems. It also discusses the concept of agents being aware of contradictions in their knowledge. 

However, without more specific details about the methodology, results, and comparison with existing methods, it's hard to definitively say whether it represents a publication-worthy innovation. It would be beneficial to see a more detailed comparison with the methods used in the 'Epistemic Neural Networks' and 'Interpretable Self-Aware Neural Networks for Robust Trajectory Prediction' papers. 

The paper could potentially benefit from incorporating elements from these papers, such as the use of evidential deep learning for uncertainty estimation in the latter paper. It would also be helpful to see how the LSTM agents paper's approach to self-awareness compares to the epistemic self-knowledge discussed in these papers. 

In conclusion, the LSTM agents paper presents some intriguing ideas, but a more detailed comparison with existing literature and a more thorough explanation of the methodology and results would be necessary to determine its potential for publication.
