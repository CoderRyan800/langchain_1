Title: "Epistemic Self-Awareness in LSTM-Based Agents: A Novel Approach to Uncertainty Quantification and Interpretability"

I. Introduction
- Brief overview of the study's focus on LSTM-based agents and their ability to understand their own knowledge state.
- Explanation of the concept of self-awareness in the context of this study.
- Brief mention of the two papers on epistemic self-awareness that will be cited later in the paper.

II. Background and Literature Review
- Overview of the field of neural networks and symbolic reasoning.
- Discussion of previous work on self-awareness in neural networks.
- Review of the two papers on epistemic self-awareness, discussing their findings and relevance to this study.
