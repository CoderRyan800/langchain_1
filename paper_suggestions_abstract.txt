This document presents a demonstration of a dual agent system, where two artificial intelligence agents cooperate to solve logical problems. Each agent is initially given a set of facts or knowledge. When presented with a question, if an agent lacks sufficient information to answer, it requests help from the other agent. The second agent then shares its knowledge, allowing the first agent to reason and find the answer. This process is illustrated through several examples, demonstrating the agents' ability to recognize their own knowledge gaps, request assistance, and utilize shared information. The document also includes technical details on how to set up and run the demonstration, as well as the results of the system's performance on a validation dataset.
