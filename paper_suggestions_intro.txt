This research paper explores the concept of agent cooperation in the realm of artificial intelligence, specifically focusing on symbolic propositional reasoning. The study presents a deep learning neural network model that utilizes LSTM and Dense layers to perform a limited symbolic propositional reasoning task. The model is designed to simulate two agents, each possessing different pieces of knowledge. The agents are capable of recognizing their own knowledge limitations and can request assistance from each other to fill in the gaps. This paper presents two examples of this process, demonstrating how the agents interact and share knowledge to reach a conclusion. The research also includes a discussion on the training of these agents and potential future directions for this work.
