This document discusses a system of two agents, Agent 1 and Agent 2, that are given certain pieces of knowledge. These agents are capable of recognizing when they lack the necessary information to answer a question and can request help from each other. When asked for help, an agent can dump its knowledge state to assist the other. This system is demonstrated through examples where the agents are given logical statements and asked to determine the truth value of a variable. The document also discusses a neural network that was trained to perform these tasks, with an error rate of less than 1% on the validation data set. The network is trained to respond to a question with the correct answer and to respond to a request for help by providing a condensed form of knowledge. The document also provides a link to a demo and the source code.
