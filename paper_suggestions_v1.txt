To rewrite this document for a peer-reviewed journal like PLoS ONE, you need to follow the structure and guidelines provided by the journal. Here's a detailed outline and steps to follow:

Title: 
"Neural Networks and Symbolic Reasoning: A Study on Self-Awareness and Agent Cooperation"

Abstract:
Provide a brief summary of the research, including the purpose, methods used, key findings, and implications.

1. Introduction:
   - Background of neural networks and symbolic reasoning.
   - Importance and relevance of the study.
   - Objectives of the research.

2. Literature Review:
   - Discuss previous work in the field of neural networks and symbolic reasoning.
   - Discuss the use of LSTMs for neuro-symbolic tasks.
   - Discuss self-awareness in neural networks.

3. Methodology:
   - Explain the problem agents are trained to solve.
   - Discuss the training and validation data for the agents.
   - Explain the use of LSTM-based seq2seq architecture.
   - Discuss the source code and its sources.

4. Results:
   - Discuss the agent cooperation examples.
   - Discuss the key results, including the error rate and the validation data set.

5. Discussion:
   - Interpret the results.
   - Discuss the concept of learning a knowledge state.
   - Discuss the agents' ability to answer a question if the answer is known and to recognize a lack of knowledge.

6. Future Work:
   - Discuss possible future directions, including adding a broader range of problems, having agents dump knowledge more selectively, and changing from the existing LSTM-based seq2seq architecture to the Transformer based architecture.

7. Conclusion:
   - Summarize the findings and their implications.
   - Discuss the contribution of the research to the field.

8. Acknowledgements:
   - Acknowledge the feedback and advice received from others.

9. References:
   - Cite all the references used in the research.
