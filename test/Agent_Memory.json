Here is the relevant part of the code:\n\n```python\n# To test exception handling, we are intentionally\n# going to trigger a division by zero exception.\n\ndummy_var = 1 / 0\n```\n\nThis line is causing the ZeroDivisionError. If you want to avoid this error, you should remove or comment out this line, or handle the exception using a try/except block. If this line is necessary for your testing, you might want to handle the exception in a way that doesn't interrupt your program's execution.",
