This error is typically raised when you try to divide a number by zero, which is mathematically undefined.\n\nLooking at the source code, the line `dummy_var = 1 / 0` is where the error is occurring. This line is trying to divide 1 by 0, which is causing the `ZeroDivisionError`. \n\nTo fix this error, you should avoid dividing by zero. If the denominator could potentially be zero, you should add a condition to check this before performing the division. For example:\n\n```python\nif denominator != 0:\n    result = numerator / denominator\nelse:\n    result = None  # or some other value that makes sense in your context\n```\n\nPlease replace the denominator with a non-zero value or add a condition to handle the zero division case.",
